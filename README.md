# Story Metadata Web Scraper

This is the code for a web scraper that stores short story metadata in an SQLite database. The goal was to make a tool allowing users to easily search stories by tags and other traits.

Since the scraping is finished and the database is populated, I can do whatever I need to do with simple database queries, so I don't think I'm going to make a frontend or try and market it.
